Goal: create a single page web app able to fetch 
posts mentioning Finland from Reddit using Reddit API.

What I need to do:
- file communicating with reddit API
- create boilerplate HTML
- create js file 

Structure/features:
- Purely posts, indefinite scrolling?
- Finland on Reddit heading
- searchbar
- one single page
- click on 'comments' to get comments
- filter by 'all', 'Finland', or 'Suomi'


Use:
- React
- Redux
- Reddit JSON API
 -> https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON


Styling:
- Main colour: blue
- solid Finland as tab icon
- when input is clicked make border white
